### Gameplay overview: 
 - 2 player RPG Card game
 - Turn based
 - Strategy and Luck 

### Basic rules: 
 - Each player has a deck of 6 fantasy cards, the data for which is generated randomly from a  -  locally saved file. 
 - Each player chooses one the cards in the deck. When used once, the card is removed from the deck of cards.
 - Each card has certain health and number of dices.
 - When both players choose a card, the match begins. 
 - Each player rolls the dices his chosen card has. The sum of each dice gives the total damage the opponent card receives.
 - When the card's health reaches 0, the card disappears and the player has to choose new card from his deck.
 - When a player loses all his cards from the deck he loses the game.
